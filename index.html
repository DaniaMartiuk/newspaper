  <p id="p2">SCIENCE: robotic car</p>
  <p id="p3">robotic car An autonomous car (also known as a driverless car, self-driving car, robotic car, autos) and unmanned ground vehicle is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and navigating without human input. Autonomous cars use a variety
    of techniques to detect their surroundings, such as radar, laser light, GPS, odometry and computer vision. Advanced control systems interpret sensory information to identify appropriate navigation paths, as well as obstacles and relevant signage.
    Autonomous cars must have control systems that are capable of analyzing sensory data to distinguish between different cars on the road. The potential benefits of autonomous cars include reduced mobility and infrastructure costs, increased safety,
    increased mobility, increased customer satisfaction and reduced crime. Specifically a significant reduction in traffic collisions; the resulting injuries; and related costs, including less need for insurance. Autonomous cars are predicted to increase
    traffic flow; provide enhanced mobility for children, the elderly, disabled and the poor; relieve travelers from driving and navigation chores; lower fuel consumption; significantly reduce needs for parking space; reduce crime; and facilitate business
    models for transportation as a service, especially via the sharing economy. This shows the vast disruptive potential of the emerging technology. A frequently cited paper by Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey found that autonomous cars would make
    many jobs redundant.
